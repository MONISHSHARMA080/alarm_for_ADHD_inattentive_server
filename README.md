# alarm_for_ADHD_inattentive_server

### to do ----

1> well I will have my alarm  app and the monitor app on phone and a go binary running on my pc, If I have set a task in the alarm app on a timer(see the alarm app to do stick expanding to do app) to the starting timer will wake the server up and the server will wake the go code up to start running ; the go code and monitor app on android will tell the server what the  user(me) is doing , if I am found to be using a website that is in the block list then we will set a alarm every 1min and increase the frequency, also we can ask LLM if the site being used is good or not (and cache it too), handle subdomains too like scholar should be not used and drive should
2> make it hard to uninstall , such  that it takes cooldown time before user can delete it
